            See UHM-1065.
            In our present information model, all Obs.obsDatetime should be equal to Obs.encounter.encounterDatetime,
            however due to a bug, 2/3 of obs are stored with the wrong datetime (though the vast majority are off by
            less than a day).
            This changeset is written so it gets run only one time, in case in the future we change our information
            model to include obs whose datatime is not equal to the encounter they are in (e.g. a form that captures
            multiple past lab results, each with its own date).

            See UHM-1230: With UHM-1220 the code fix was made to correctly store phone numbers when entered as blank.
            Prior to that ticket, they were being stored as "false" in the database.
            In all of the environments (including production) there are several instances of them being false as a
            result of this bug. This changeset removes all person_attributes with value = false

            See UHM-1283. Make sure no patient has more than one preferred address
            First query finds a list of all person_address_ids for persons that have more than one preferred address.
            The second query does the same, *except* that it only records a single person_address_id for each patient--
            the one with the lowest value.
            Third query updates sets preferred=0 for all person_addresses in the first set but not in the second set.

            UHM-4523 Add Wellbody MCH location to Sierra Leone
            0561303b-9868-4a1d-933d-fe52ce1b8c9f is Wellbody uuid, only run on existing Liberia servers
            (this will also skip when installing new servers since locations will not yet
            be installed)
            Note that the "onFail" is "CONTINUE"... this is because the first time this is run on Wellbody prod
            the new "Wellbody" location will likely not have been installed, so we will need to run this
            changeset twice
