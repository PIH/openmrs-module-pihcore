            UHM-3923 Migrate Diabetes 2 to Diabetes Type 2 Insulin Dependent for NCD encounters
               For Version 2, Diabetes Type 2 (insulin-dependent) and (not insulin-dependent) were introduced.
               Darius Fenelon wanted to migrate all the general Type 2 Diabetes to the insulin-dependent data
               since that's more common.
